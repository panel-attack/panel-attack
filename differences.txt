In Tetris Attack, it seems like a panel cannot match in the same frame
that it does some other state transition.  This is implemented in panel
attack by performing the matches check before the other state transitions.
The result is very dirty...

In Tetris Attack, the rising of the stack is not smooth around displacement=0.
This part of the animation takes just as long regardless of speed.
This is most noticeable if you use L or R, the stack will sort of jitter on
its way up.  I have no plans to implement this.

In Tetris Attack, only one pair of panels can be swaping at any time, and
the new swap can only be created in some frames of the old swap.  In
panel-attack, swaps cannot occur on consecutive frames, but I think
this is less strict than the rule enforced by Tetris Attack about the
timing of back-to-back swaps.

In Tetris Attack, you get nothing for chains past 13.  I will probably
implement things for chains past 13.

The procedures for generating initial configurations of panels and clusters
of [!] blocks bear only a superficial resemblance to the ones employed in
Tetris Attack.  Many fewer initial configurations are posible in Tetris Attack,
and Tetris Attack's procedure for [!] blocks is based on how many
panels the player clears, while panel-attack's is not.



In Tetris Attack, a stack of garbage that should all begin falling at the same
time will occasionally separate.  panel-attack will not implement this bug.

In Panel de Pon (but not in Tetris Attack), a manual rise that is interrupted
by a match will finish after the match and rise lock end.  panel-attack
will not implement this bug.

In Panel de Pon (but not in Tetris Attack), a 32 combo gives too many points.
panel-attack will not implement this bug.
