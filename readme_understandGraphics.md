This document tries to explain how Panel Attack loads and displays graphics from mods (characters, panels, stages, themes).  

# Panel Attack

Panel Attack internally works with a canvas size of 1280x720.  
This means that all positions of graphics internally as well as in the configuration of a theme will be relative to this base canvas.
