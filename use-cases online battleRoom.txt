use-cases online battleRoom

catching up on an on-going match
-> catch up screen -> match
there should be a catchup transition that takes a match on top of the scenes and displays catchup progress

watching a match to end, new match starts
-> switch to the new game scene with the new match

there should generally be a message transition that adopts the role of the old dumb transition I guess
