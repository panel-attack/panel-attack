# Panel Attack Development

## Development Setup

Install the **32-bit** version of love (http://love2d.org/)

Clone a copy of the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/panel-attack/panel-attack.git
```  
We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) as it manages login for you and makes working with git easier.
  
We recommend developing and running the game using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
You can setup VSCode with a debugger and more [following this tutorial](https://sheepolution.com/learn/book/bonus/vscode).

Alternatively, you can edit with your own favorite text editor and run love from the command line

```
cd Panel-Attack
love ./
```

or via drag and drop with the repository folder (not recommended).

# For Maintainers

## Releasing

To make a release we create a love file and put it on the server. Change the name of the love file to the output of a command like this:  
    Stable:  
        `echo "panel-$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S").love"`  
    Beta:  
        `echo "panel-beta-$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S").love"`  

Secure copy the file to the server in correct folder on the server.  
    Stable:  
        `scp -i privatekey.pem panel-2022-06-25_03-50-14.love username@panelattack.com:updates`  
    Beta:  
        `scp -i privatekey.pem panel-2022-06-25_03-50-14.love username@panelattack.com:beta-updates`  

Test that the game updates properly.  

Post release notes in #panel-attack-updates on the discord.

### Releasing a new full release with auto updating

First make a love file, then copy that all into the auto updater folder and make that a love file.  
Then copy the windows files in to your release folder.  
Tack the autoupdater love file on the end of the exe.  
Release a zip of the whole release directory.
