# Panel Attack Development

## Development Setup

### Installing love

The current stable version uses love 11.5. Simply install from http://love2d.org/.  
The beta version is the main development version and uses love 12.0.  
Love 12 is still in development. You can find love 12.0 CI builds in the [love repository](https://github.com/love2d/love/actions/workflows/main.yml).
Simply pick the newest workflow run, scroll down and select the artifact suitable for your machine.

### Setting up the Panel Attack repository

Clone a copy of the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/panel-attack/panel-attack.git
```  
We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) as it manages login for you and makes working with git easier.
  
We recommend developing and running the game using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
You can setup VSCode with a debugger and more [following this tutorial](https://sheepolution.com/learn/book/bonus/vscode).

Alternatively, you can edit with your own favorite text editor and run love from the command line

```
cd Panel-Attack
love ./
```

or via drag and drop with the repository folder (not recommended).

## Release schedule

### Main releases
Panel Attack currently has 3 release streams that see updates at varying rates.

#### canary release
Cutting edge build, automatically generated with every push to beta.  
Available via https://github.com/panel-attack/panel-attack/releases.

#### beta release
beta release, a bit more tested than canary.
Features are released on beta if there is some confidence that they're mostly working correctly.

Release notes are posted in #panel-attack-updates on the discord when updates go out.

#### stable release
stable release, tested features that just work.  
Stable releases take tournament dates into consideration so that any bugs that may still get caught don't interfere with them.

# For Maintainers

## Releasing

To make a release we create a love file and put it on the server. Change the name of the love file to the output of a command like this:  
    Stable:  
        `echo "panel-$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S").love"`  
    Beta:  
        `echo "panel-beta-$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S").love"`  

Secure copy the file to the server in correct folder on the server.  
    Stable:  
        `scp -i privatekey.pem panel-2022-06-25_03-50-14.love username@panelattack.com:updates`  
    Beta:  
        `scp -i privatekey.pem panel-2022-06-25_03-50-14.love username@panelattack.com:beta-updates`  

Test that the game updates properly.  

Post release notes in #panel-attack-updates on the discord.
