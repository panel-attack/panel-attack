-- Tests a replay doing the following use cases
-- Note this doesn't test the TouchInputController currently because it just executes the already encoded inputs.

-- Touch and drag to swap, then release
-- Expected:
-- Cursor appears, Panels dragged swap, cursor is removed

-- Touch and drag into a matching column and release
-- Cursor should stay
-- Expected:
-- Can tap to insert into the lingering spot
-- Can tap to swap with the opposite spot

-- Touch and drag into a matching column and release
-- Cursor should stay
-- Tap repeatedly until you can insert
-- Expected:
-- Can tap repeatedly and insert if timed right

-- Touch and drag into a matching column, don’t release
-- Expected:
-- No swap (game doesn’t buffer)

-- Touch and drag into a matching column and release
-- Cursor should stay
-- Touch a non adjacent panel
-- Expected:Cursor changes to new spot

-- Touch and drag across a whole row then release
-- Expected:
-- Cursor swaps fast on the first two swaps (stealth) slower on the remaining)

-- Touch and drag a panel so it falls
-- Expected:
-- Panel falls, becomes deselected

-- Setup a chain so a panel is about to match, touch and hold that panel
-- Expected:
-- Panel matches, becomes deselected
